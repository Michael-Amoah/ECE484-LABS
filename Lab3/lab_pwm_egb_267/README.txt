What is Pulse Width Modulation?
A digital signal that turns on and off depending on a duty cycle.

What does it allow us to do in a practical sense?
To regulate the amount of voltage.

What do microprocessors have on them to help create PWM signals
They have timers, so the microprocessor doesn't have to count for a duty cycle.
